Welcome to Rednote Bar. This site is designed to help foreign friends better understand Xiaohongshu (Rednote) as well as Chinese social media and culture.

As one of the most popular social media platforms in China, Xiaohongshu brings together a wealth of lifestyle content, shopping shares, and user experiences.
Through this website, I hope to provide you with an in-depth introduction to Xiaohongshu, helping you become familiar with the platform's features and usage tips.

Understanding Chinese social media can not only help you communicate better with Chinese friends but also allow you to experience and understand Chinese culture more deeply. Here, you will find guides on using Xiaohongshu, cultural background information, trending topics, and suggestions for interacting with Chinese friends.
